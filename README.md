RemoteMap and codec for Reason Studios and the Behringer X-Touch One

Will update the readme with more detail soon. For now, I'd just like to say thank you to https://www.jaexx.com/blog/reason-custom-behringer-x-touch-remote-map-layout/
for the initial work on the 8 track version of the X-Touch that gave me a quickstart with this.
